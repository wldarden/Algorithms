Chemical engineering encompasses the development, application, and operation of processes in which chemical, biological, and/or physical changes of material are involved. The work of the chemical engineer is to analyze, develop, design, control, construct, and/or supervise chemical processes in research and development, pilot-scale operations, and industrial production. The undergraduate curriculum emphasizes the application of experimental and computer analysis to classical chemical engineering principles. This includes laboratory instruction in modern, state-of-the-art facilities in the transport phenomena, unit operations, and process control laboratories. Students are instructed in and utilize state-of-the-art computational programs such as Aspen, MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics. In order to meet students interests in chemical engineering and related fields, elective courses are available in bioengineering, polymer engineering, materials engineering, electrochemical engineering, environmental engineering, and biomedical engineering. The major options in Chemical-Materials Engineering and Biomedical Engineering build upon the core classical chemical engineering principles developed initially for the original major in Chemical Engineering. Consult an advisor for specific requirements for the three major options.
